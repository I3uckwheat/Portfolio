# Snake-JS

This project was a project created for TOP curriculum. This was written from scratch without a framework or any sort of tutorial.
I found this project to be moderate in difficulty. It was difficult figuring out which pattern to follow when building this project.

I decided to follow the module design pattern as best i could. This code works, however I realize the modules are tightly coupled
and could be refactored to be better, which i plan on doing later, when i have more expereince. 

I am very happy how this turned out, I plan on improving the CSS after going through a course for it. I feel with a little
refactoring and a facelift wtih CSS, this could be a good portfolio piece. Overall I am happy with the execution, and other people seem to enjoy playing it as much as any other snake game. I have had suggestions to make it work offline locally and to add a difficulty slider.
