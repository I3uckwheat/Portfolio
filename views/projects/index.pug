          p This site was built for a fire department, It was built with express, using the pug templating engine. The website features a full administrative panel with administrator privileges and management. After building this site, the administrators of the site can change the content themselves, including most images.

          p Configz.me addresses the problem of easily moving around configuraiton files, specifically dotfiles. This came about when I found I was cloning from github frequently on the multiple servers I was working on to grab my .vimrc configuration. I figured a clean API with curl would be a great solution. I now use this to manage my configuration files.
          br
          p Feel free to use it, it doesn't encrypt the dotfiles, but all passwords are stored as a salted hash. It was built with Node/Express.js.
